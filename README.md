# API-RecipeRelish

A simple recipe managing website with API integration for fresh new recipes. 

#The API used in this website is from spoonacular. 

This is recipe website that allows users to view hundreds of new recipes per every refresh of the page as well as search for recipes. Users will be able to edit their weekly meal planners and also save recipes that interest them. They can create an account just so they wonâ€™t lose progress when closing the tab and come back to view it when they need to check their meals for the next day. 

This website can be viewed normally without requiring any additional set up. It makes use of the normal JavaScript framework as well as Vue JS to specifically support API integration. My website has a total of 5 pages each with their own stylesheet and an external JavaScript file to handle all the complex functions. 

The pages include 
   - Home page(project.html)
   - Meal-planner(mealplanner.html)
   - Account(login.html and account.html)
   - About Us(about.html)
